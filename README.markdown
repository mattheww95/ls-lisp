# ls-Lisp
A simple clone of the gnu ls utility. Currently it is no where near as functional as 'ls' but it is a start. This merely a hobby project to stay fresh on lisp and develop better lisp skills. I may add more utilities to it in the future such as providing the ability to list directories on remote file systems as well.

## Usage
Still a lot to do, but one day it should work the same as ls.


## Installation

I have not gotten that far yet... requires but requires:
- osicat
- unix-opts
- sbcl
- quicklisp
